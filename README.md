#### Overview

This repository is my version of the Proto-8_Generic_Synth as outlined and shown at repository "marshalltaylorSFE/Proto-8_Generic_Synth"

Starting from my design of a generic panel connected to the Proto-8 hardware, this repo shows the build up of software that results in an approximate digital clone of a Minimoog Model D synthesizer.
